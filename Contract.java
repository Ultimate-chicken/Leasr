/** This is a core class in our model. In the controller, we have a contract arrayList that includes objects of type contract, but we will have
 * objects of subclasses given that we cannot have objects of an abstract class. Essentially, this class acts as a middleman that gets common
 * fields among the different types of objects, but lets the subclasses execute their own fields and methods (through abstract and overrided
 * methods). 
 * This is a core class in our model. Objects of type contract are stored in an array list within the controller, but given that contract is 
 * abstract (and recurringContract, as we will see later), we will only store objects of type lease, purchase, or rent-to-own. The contract 
 * class acts as the middle man between the controller and the subclasses, using parameters from the controller (such as contract ID) by 
 * "shadowing them and instantiating them on the constructor. A key field here is productSelection, which is an arrayList of <Product> 
 * objects that can be used to calculate price, get details, etcetera. This is stored in the contract because it is a common attribute for
 * all subclasses. @author (Noah, Max) @version (28/03/2025) */
