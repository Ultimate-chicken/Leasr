//Add @override to abstract method. In abstract class: public abstract void methodName(); 
//In interfaces: public void methodName(); Every field in an interface is static and final. Also serve to implement common methods.
//JUnit testing: when a piece of code is tested by itself. For classes or methods. 
//for polymorphism: child extends parent. SUPER is used to call methods in the superclass and overide them on the child class.
//For example, super.makeNoise() calls the method from the parent class within the child class. 
//If you create a method in the super class and don't implement own version in child class, it will automatically get the super version.
//private methods in the superclass cannot be accessed with the super keyword by child classes. 
//in the constructor of subclasses, you can pass fields already constructed in the superclass with super(param1, param2). Only in constructor. Must be 1st line.
//As for products, because the array of products is in te controller, we will include references (getIndex) in the array of products of the contract subclasses.
//when you create a subclass, you get all fields and methods of the parent class. Polymorphism is about overiding methods in the parent class.
//overloading can be the same but with different paramters. 
//instanceof is to check the subclass.
