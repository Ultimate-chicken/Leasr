/** This is a subclass of contract (not of recurringContract). Its main functionalities are to override toString from contract class, execute
 * the calculateTotalCost() abstract method, and calculate warranty of the product bundle. A simple if statement is used for this. We can
 * see though that at the toString method we employ getters from the contract class, as they are protected (not private). This prevents us
 * from having to do everything over again locally. Because we have no local methods with the same name/signature as those from the contract
 * class, we don't need to specify super.method(), but it won't harm us if we do. @author (Noah, Max) @version (28/03/2025) */
